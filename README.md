## Testing Prose
http://prose.io/

Hey, don't mind me, I'm just pushing buttons...

Oh, OK. I think I understand how to use this now.

## TODO
2. Make and edit content with prose

## Testing Prose round 2 (Shoshana style)

Pushing buttons is **fun**.

My favorite buttons are:

- @ key
- Control (not that I'm a control freak)
- And the apple key, which I still call the splat key

_So is markdown used in Redmine updates?_
